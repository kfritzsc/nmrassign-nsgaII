# A simple hand-made makefile nsga2

# This makefile works with the GNU make command, the one find on

#$intro
# ======================================================================
# Here comes the most interesting part: the rules for prog1, prog2,
# prog3 and prog4, modify to suit your needs
# ======================================================================

# In order to understand the next section, the process of building an
# executable has to be clear: this is typically done in two steps:

# 1.Compilation: every source file required for our program (tipically
# x.f90 or x.F90 in case of Fortran) is compiled into an object file
# (usually x.o)
# 2.Linking: the final executable file is built by "linking" together
# all the object files compiled in the previous step; in this step
# additional pre-compiled libraries of can be added, but this will not
# be treated here.

# These two steps are often performed through the same command and can
# be combined into a single operation, so it is easy to confuse them,
# but, in order to understand what comes further, one has to keep in
# mind that they are logically different operations.

# A general suggestion: when building an executable called "prog", a
# good practice is to put the main program, i.e. the procedure
# declared as "PROGRAM" in Fortran, in a file named "prog.f90" or
# "prog.F90", after the name of the executable, this will simplify the
# creation of the rules in the makefile.

#$part1
# The simplest case: prog1 is simply built from prog1.f90 through
# prog1.o; there is nothing to specify for prog1, because this simple
# situation is already handled by the general rules for building
# executables from Fortran sources.

#$part2
# Including a file: prog2, as before, is simply built from prog2.f90
# through prog2.o; however prog2.o, besides depending on prog2.f90,
# depends also on prog2.incf through inclusion, if prog2.incf is newer
# than prog2.o, prog2.o has to be rebuilt; this has to be specified in
# the makefile by means of a particular rule; it is not necessary to
# confirm the dependency of prog2.o on prog2.f90, as well as of prog2
# on prog2.o, since they are already handled by the general rules:
# prog2.o: prog2.incf

#$part3
# Calling external procedures: prog3 requires to link in not just
# prog3.o, as usual, but also aux.o, which contains a subroutine
# called from within prog3.f90; moreover prog3 has to be rebuilt if
# aux.o is newer than prog3 itself; both tasks are accomplished by
# adding an explicit dependency for the executable on aux.o; as
# before, there is no need to confirm that prog3 depends on prog3.o,
# that prog3.o depends on prog3.f90 and that aux.o depends on aux.f90
# since these dependencies are already handled by the general rules:
# prog3: aux.o

#$part4
# Using Fortran MODULES: prog4.f90 USEs a Fortran module defined
# inside mod.f90, this is similar to the include case (prog2), but,
# since there is no standard naming convention for compiled module
# files in f90, the dependency is more easily built on the object
# files, because when mod.o is generated, one is sure that
# any_module_inside_mod.mod has been newly generated as well; mod.o
# must also be linked in when building the executable, so the
# dependency on mod.o is added also for prog4, as in the external
# procedure case (prog3):
nsga2_main.o: qsort_c_module.o
nsga2_main: qsort_c_module.o

nsga2_main.o: nsga2_module.o
nsga2_main: nsga2_module.o
# qsort_c_module.o

#$part5
# Putting it all together: when an executable is built from many
# sources, ALL the object files have to be specified in the executable
# dependencies, not just those containing SUBROUTINEs, FUNCTIONs or
# MODULEs that are directly CALLed or USEd in the main program
# file. However among the dependencies of the main program object
# file, only those that are directly CALLed or USEd inside it have to
# be specified, the other object files have to be specified as
# dependencies of the relevant object files that require them and will
# be built by a chain rule.

#$conclusion
# ======================================================================
# And now the general rules, these should not require modification
